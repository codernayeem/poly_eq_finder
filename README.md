# poly_eq_finder

Find **Polynomial equation** from given **inputs** and **outputs**. It has both **C++** & **Python** versions.

## Steps:
* Assume ***y*** = poynomial equation of ***x***
* Enter how many inputs & outputs you know. **(Suppose 2)**
* Enter the inputs & ouputs one by one **(x=1 y=6, x=3 y=10)**
* In a blink of an eye, you will get the equation **(2x+4)**
